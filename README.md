This is a console that everyone can use. It has all the power of bash without having to use cryptic commands. The suggestions and tab-to-complete make the interface quite quick despite the longer names for commands. The suggestions make learning new commands incredibly easy. However, it is also fully backwards compatible with console commands (bash or your shell of choice).

Many unix things were made more simple, for example `rm -r` for folders and `rm` for files has been simplified to one "delete" command.

Many things like permissions have been totally overhauled into a Q&A system. (See pictures below)

# Development

This app is functional but in alpha. At the moment it is only being developed for Mac. Once the mac version is complete, I may work on a Linux version. Work on this likely won't be finished till at least the fall semester of 2017. All the basic bash commands have been added. The larest two hurdles remaining are getting SSH to work seamlessly/securely, and also getting all of the depenecies in working order. 

The app is being built using Electron.
