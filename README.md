This app lets you have the power of terminal/Unix/Bash without having to use cryptic commands. This is an app grandmothers and non-programmers would greatly appreciate. The suggestions and tab-to-complete make the interface quite quick despite the longer names for commands.

Rather than a command line, the interface looks like iMessage and the Google Assistant.
Rather than abbreviations such as "ls" , "cd" , "mv" , "pwd" commands are verbal "show files", "go to " , "move", "where am I".

This app is currently in alpha and at the moment is only for Mac. Once the mac version is complete, I plan to work on a linux version, and after linux is complete Windows 10 will be considered.
